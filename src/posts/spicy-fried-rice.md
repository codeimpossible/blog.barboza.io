This is another one of our favorite recipes because you can add almost anything to it. It's useful when you want to use all the random ingredients in your fridge, or when you want to warm up on a cold night.

## Ingredients


- 3 tsp Red pepper flakes- Fresh Garlic Cloves, diced (2-3 should be good)- 1/2 cup Diced Onion (Sweet Onion, White, Red, your pick)- 3 tsp Kosher Salt- 3oz Grape Seed Oil (Sunflower, Peanut or any other high-heat oil will work)- 2-3 Eggs, beaten- 4tsp Soy Sauce- 6tsp Gochujang paste or Sriracha- Jalapenos, serranos, habeneros (optional)- 1-1 1/2 cups of Rice, cooked  according to directions (I've used Basmati, Jasmine, even Sushi rice for this recipe successfully)

## Tools


- Mortar and Pestle- Large saute pan

## Directions


In the mortar and pestle put the Salt, Red Pepper Flakes, diced Garlic and 1tsp of the Oil. Work it around until it's well mixed and is fragrant.

Pour the Oil into your saute pan and heat it on high until it sizzles when a wooden spoon is inserted. Add the onion and hot peppers and cook until translucent, about 2 minutes.

Add the rice, watch out for splashing if the rice is wet. Let the rice cook for 3-4 minutes, getting nice and crispy.

Add the mortar and pestle mixture, Soy Sauce, and Gochujang or Sriracha and mix vigorously. Once everything is mixed, push the rice to the side of the pan and pour the beaten eggs into the empty area. Keep stirring the eggs as they cook, being careful not to burn them. Once they are firm, start breaking them up and mix them into the rice.

Once everything is mixed, serve immediately.
