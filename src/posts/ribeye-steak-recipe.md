If you've read the cookbook <a href="http://amzn.to/2ucvciD" target="_blank" rel="noopener">"Momofoku" by David Chang</a> then there won't be a whole lot of new information here. David recommends using a dry-aged ribeye but his recipe is just as wonderful on any store-bought ribeye you can get.

I will strongly urge you to get steaks that are on the thicker side, 1-1 1/2 inches thick as that will A) give you more steak to eat, and B) allow the cooking times in this recipe to be more accurate.

I'll also recommend using a cast iron skillet like David says to in his recipe tho I wouldn't say this is a strong requirement. I've made these ribeyes using normal non-stick skillets and then roasting them in a sheet pan in the oven.

And finally, you don't need the bone-in ribeyes (especially if you are making this for multiple people). Just sear all the edges of the steak when the recipe calls for searing the side away from the bone.
## The Perfect Ribeye - adapted from Momofoku

Ingredients

- 1 1-2lb ribeye (bone-in preferred), at least 1-inch thick
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
- Kosher salt
- Fresh cracked black pepper
- 2 crushed (smashed) garlic cloves, or a few pinches of garlic powder
- 1tbsp Grape seed oil

Equipment

- 10-12 inch cast iron skillet
- oven
- yer mitts

Directions

Heat your oven to 400 degrees. Get your cast iron skillet heated up, we want it to be so hot that it is just about to start smoking. While the skillet is heating up rub both sides of the ribeye(s) with the oil and season liberally with salt and pepper. How much salt and pepper? David Chang said it best:
<blockquote>"season the steak liberally with salt--like you'd salt a sidewalk in New York in the winter--and then with pepper."</blockquote>
At this point you can also season the steaks with garlic powder if you're going that route.

Throw the steaks into the cast iron skillet. They should sizzle *aggressively* when they hit the pan. Don't touch the steak for two minutes. Seriously, don't press on it, don't move it, *do. not. touch. it.*

After two minutes check the steaks they should lift easily from the skillet and they should be an awesome golden brown and have a great crust. Flip the steaks over and repeat the searing for another two minutes.

After this pick the steaks up and sear the side of the ribeyes opposite the side with the bone for 30 seconds. Don't cheat here, a full thirty count is necessary to render that side of the steak and lock in the flavor.

Now put the skillet (or transfer your steaks to a roasting pan) into the oven and roast them for 8 minutes. Again: *don't touch the steaks.* Leave them for the full eight minutes.

If you like your steaks extra rare, stop here. Otherwise we'll move on to the fun part. Take the two tablespoons of butter and throw it in the skillet with the crushed garlic. Once it melts, add the steaks and begin basting the steaks with the butter.

Tip the skillet up 45 degrees and collect all the juices in the bottom of the pan in a spoon and spoon it over each steak repeatedly for two minute. Don't stop this process, baste constantly.

After two minutes of basting the steaks should be medium rare, squishy-soft but not firm. Remove the steaks from the heat, put them on a cutting board and let them rest for 10 minutes. This will let all the juices in the steak settle inside the steak which will make each bite full of flavor the steak more tender.

After ten minutes has passed, cut the steak into 1/2 inch thick slices and serve. I'd recommend some sort of starch (maybe a puree or hash) or even a roasted root vegetable assortment as a companion.
