The past few days has been a whirlwind of pixel art activity. I've been absolutely *cranking* out characters, I'm not sure where all this inspiration is coming from but I'm not going to complain. I was able to get animations and designs done for pretty much every boss I want to include in Electric Noir and a few new basic enemies as well.

Here is the Electric Noir Rogues Gallery!
