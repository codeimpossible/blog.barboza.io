I had a wicked migraine this afternoon, so I grabbed some water took some advil and went to bed right after work. About 3-4 hours later, I finally woke up from my migraine nap and felt better enough to do some final testing on the prototype. 

Things are looking pretty good, so I'm gonna post it and hope for the best :smile: [here is the new prototype that I've been working on since march](https://troublecat.itch.io/electric-noir). 

Also, here's an updated control scheme image.

I strongly recommend playing this with a gamepad as I haven't fully tested or implemented keyboard support yet.
