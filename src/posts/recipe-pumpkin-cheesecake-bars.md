Crust:

- graham cracker crumbs, or gingersnap crumbs, or both!
- granulated sugar
- melted butter

Pumpkin Layer:

- canned pumpkin (pure pumpkin – not pumpkin pie mix)
- heavy cream
- eggs
- granulated sugar
- vanilla extract
- pumpkin pie spice

Cheesecake Swirl:

- cream cheese
- egg + an extra egg yolk
- granulated sugar
- vanilla extract

Directions:

These pumpkin cheesecake bars may look very impressive, but they are surprisingly easy to whip together.
First we start with the crust: crushed graham crackers (or gingersnaps), butter and sugar pressed into the bottom of a 9×13 casserole dish.
Whip together the pumpkin pie layer, seasoned with pumpkin spice, and pour it on top of the graham cracker layer.
Then we beat together the cream cheese, eggs, sugar and vanilla until smooth. Pour it on top of the pumpkin layer and then drag a knife through the cheesecake and pumpkin layers to create a marbled look. 
Bake for about 40 minutes, cool and refrigerate. Serve chilled!
