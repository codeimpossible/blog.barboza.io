It took me a while to get this working but I finally got a vertlet backed rope sim working in unity. I used [this blog post a reference](http://toqoz.fyi/game-rope.html) and was able to get the solution working within a few hours.

I plan on using it as part of polish for the game to add objects that react to the player in levels (like vines that brush out of the way, electrical cables, etc), but you could easily use this for climbable ropes or even as part of a larger rope-based sim (think rope lader or a rope bridge).
