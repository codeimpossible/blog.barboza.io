Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,<br>          the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,<br>          non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to<br>          exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:<br><br>            a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or<br>               in part; and<br><br>            b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.<br><br>       2. Exceptions and Limitations.

For purposes of this Public License,<br>          simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)<br>          (4) never produces Adapted Material.<br><br>       5.

Additional offer from the Licensor -- Adapted Material.<br>               Every recipient of Adapted Material from You<br>               automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to<br>               exercise the Licensed Rights in the Adapted Material<br>               under the conditions of the Adapter's License You apply.<br><br>            c. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose<br>               any additional or different terms or conditions on, or<br>               apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the<br>               Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the<br>               Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed<br>               Material.<br><br>       6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or<br>          may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You<br>          are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected<br>          with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,<br>          the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as<br>          provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).<br><br>  b. Other rights.<br><br>       1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not<br>          licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,<br>          privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to<br>          the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to<br>          assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited<br>          extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed<br>          Rights, but not otherwise.<br><br>       2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this<br>          Public License.<br><br>       3.

In all other cases the Licensor expressly<br>          reserves any right to collect such royalties.<br><br><br>Section 3 -- License Conditions.<br><br>Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the<br>following conditions.<br><br>  a. Attribution.<br><br>       1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified<br>          form), You must:<br><br>            a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor<br>               with the Licensed Material:<br><br>                 i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed<br>                    Material and any others designated to receive<br>                    attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by<br>                    the Licensor (including by pseudonym if<br>                    designated);<br><br>                ii. a copyright notice;<br><br>               iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;<br><br>                iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of<br>                    warranties;<br><br>                 v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the<br>                    extent reasonably practicable;<br><br>            b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and<br>               retain an indication of any previous modifications; and<br><br>            c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this<br>               Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or<br>               hyperlink to, this Public License.<br><br>       2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any<br>          reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in<br>          which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be<br>          reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or<br>          hyperlink to a resource that includes the required<br>          information.<br><br>       3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the<br>          information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent<br>          reasonably practicable.<br><br>  b. ShareAlike.<br><br>     In addition to the conditions in Section 3(a), if You Share<br>     Adapted Material You produce, the following conditions also apply.<br><br>       1. The Adapter's License You apply must be a Creative Commons<br>          license with the same License Elements, this version or<br>          later, or a BY-SA Compatible License.<br><br>       2. You must include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, the<br>          Adapter's License You apply. You may satisfy this condition<br>          in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and<br>          context in which You Share Adapted Material.<br><br>       3. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms<br>          or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological<br>          Measures to, Adapted Material that restrict exercise of the<br>          rights granted under the Adapter's License You apply.<br><br><br>Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.<br><br>Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that<br>apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:<br><br>  a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right<br>     to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial<br>     portion of the contents of the database;<br><br>  b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database<br>     contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database<br>     Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database<br>     Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material,<br><br>     including for purposes of Section 3(b); and<br>  c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share<br>     all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.<br><br>For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not<br>replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed<br>Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.<br><br><br>Section 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.<br><br>  a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE<br>     EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS<br>     AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF<br>     ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,<br>     IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,<br>     WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR<br>     PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,<br>     ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT<br>     KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT<br>     ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.<br><br>  b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE<br>     TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,<br>     NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,<br>     INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,<br>     COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR<br>     USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN<br>     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR<br>     DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR<br>     IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.<br><br>  c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided<br>     above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent<br>     possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and<br>     waiver of all liability.<br><br><br>Section 6 -- Term and Termination.<br><br>  a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and<br>     Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with<br>     this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License<br>     terminate automatically.<br><br>  b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under<br>     Section 6(a), it reinstates:<br><br>       1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided<br>          it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the<br>          violation; or<br><br>       2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.<br><br>     For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any<br>     right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations<br>     of this Public License.<br><br>  c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the<br>     Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop<br>     distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so<br>     will not terminate this Public License.<br><br>  d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public<br>     License.<br><br><br>Section 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.<br><br>  a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different<br>     terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.<br><br>  b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the<br>     Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and<br>     independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.<br><br><br>Section 8 -- Interpretation.<br><br>  a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and<br>     shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose<br>     conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully<br>     be made without permission under this Public License.<br><br>  b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is<br>     deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the<br>     minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision<br>     cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License<br>     without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and<br>     conditions.<br><br>  c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no<br>     failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the<br>     Licensor.<br><br>  d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted<br>     as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities<br>     that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal<br>     processes of any jurisdiction or authority.<br><br><br>=======================================================================<br><br>Creative Commons is not a party to its public licenses.<br>Notwithstanding, Creative Commons may elect to apply one of its public<br>licenses to material it publishes and in those instances will be<br>considered the ‚ÄúLicensor.‚Äù The text of the Creative Commons public<br>licenses is dedicated to the public domain under the CC0 Public Domain<br>Dedication.
